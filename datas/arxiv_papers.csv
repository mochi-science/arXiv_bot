To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic reasoning,"Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett",2024-09-18 17:55:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v1,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of
tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted
a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own
evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives
strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with
much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the
answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the
question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic
operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of
CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing
against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic
execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our
results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance
while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond
prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation
across the whole range of LLM applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12183v1,LLM
Decoding Style: Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Image-Guided Outfit Recommendation with Preference,"Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan",2024-09-18 17:15:06+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150v1,"Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding
both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper
presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large
language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their ""black box"" and static
nature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item
visual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style
and color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis
for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the
open-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability
to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative
examples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates
a self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in
line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore
dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank,
and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's
ability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously
improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our
proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more
cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the
proposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate
suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit
generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12150v1,LLM

report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly
including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for
audiobook production. These models are capable of zero-shot speech production,
generating high-quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human
speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according
to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec
language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a
multi-task training framework, capable of generating high-fidelity natural
speech in a zero-shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and
timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while
advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its
naturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with
highly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which
enables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre
and prosody in a precise and controllable manner. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our Takin AudioLLM series models.

Fitting Multilevel Factor Models,"Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd",2024-09-18 15:39:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12067v1,"We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance

the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and
maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved
through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive

Symmetry-Based Structured Matrices for Efficient Approximately Equivariant Networks,"Ashwin Samudre, Mircea Petrache, Brian D. Nord, Shubhendu Trivedi",2024-09-18 07:52:33+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11772v1,"There has been much recent interest in designing symmetry-aware neural
networks (NNs) exhibiting relaxed equivariance. Such NNs aim to interpolate
between being exactly equivariant and being fully flexible, affording
consistent performance benefits. In a separate line of work, certain structured
parameter matrices -- those with displacement structure, characterized by low
displacement rank (LDR) -- have been used to design small-footprint NNs.
Displacement structure enables fast function and gradient evaluation, but
permits accurate approximations via compression primarily to classical
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this work, we propose a general
framework -- based on a novel construction of symmetry-based structured
matrices -- to build approximately equivariant NNs with significantly reduced
parameter counts. Our framework integrates the two aforementioned lines of work
via the use of so-called Group Matrices (GMs), a forgotten precursor to the
modern notion of regular representations of finite groups. GMs allow the design
of structured matrices -- resembling LDR matrices -- which generalize the
linear operations of a classical CNN from cyclic groups to general finite
groups and their homogeneous spaces. We show that GMs can be employed to extend
all the elementary operations of CNNs to general discrete groups. Further, the
theory of structured matrices based on GMs provides a generalization of LDR
theory focussed on matrices with cyclic structure, providing a tool for
implementing approximate equivariance for discrete groups. We test GM-based
architectures on a variety of tasks in the presence of relaxed symmetry. We
report that our framework consistently performs competitively compared to
approximately equivariant NNs, and other structured matrix-based compression
frameworks, sometimes with a one or two orders of magnitude lower parameter
count.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11772v1,Machine Learning

MonoKAN: Certified Monotonic Kolmogorov-Arnold Network,"Alejandro Polo-Molina, David Alfaya, Jose Portela",2024-09-17 11:10:59+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11078v1,"Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have significantly advanced various fields
by effectively recognizing patterns and solving complex problems. Despite these
advancements, their interpretability remains a critical challenge, especially
in applications where transparency and accountability are essential. To address
this, explainable AI (XAI) has made progress in demystifying ANNs, yet
interpretability alone is often insufficient. In certain applications, model
predictions must align with expert-imposed requirements, sometimes exemplified
by partial monotonicity constraints. While monotonic approaches are found in
the literature for traditional Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs), they still face
difficulties in achieving both interpretability and certified partial
monotonicity. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture, based
on learnable activation functions parametrized as splines, has been proposed as
a more interpretable alternative to MLPs. Building on this, we introduce a
novel ANN architecture called MonoKAN, which is based on the KAN architecture
and achieves certified partial monotonicity while enhancing interpretability.
To achieve this, we employ cubic Hermite splines, which guarantee monotonicity
through a set of straightforward conditions. Additionally, by using positive
weights in the linear combinations of these splines, we ensure that the network
preserves the monotonic relationships between input and output. Our experiments
demonstrate that MonoKAN not only enhances interpretability but also improves
predictive performance across the majority of benchmarks, outperforming
state-of-the-art monotonic MLP approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11078v1,XAI

LLM Echo Chamber: personalized and automated disinformation,Tony Ma,2024-09-24 17:04:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16241v1,"Recent advancements have showcased the capabilities of Large Language Models
like GPT4 and Llama2 in tasks such as summarization, translation, and content
review. However, their widespread use raises concerns, particularly around the
potential for LLMs to spread persuasive, humanlike misinformation at scale,
which could significantly influence public opinion. This study examines these
risks, focusing on LLMs ability to propagate misinformation as factual. To
investigate this, we built the LLM Echo Chamber, a controlled digital
environment simulating social media chatrooms, where misinformation often
spreads. Echo chambers, where individuals only interact with like minded
people, further entrench beliefs. By studying malicious bots spreading
misinformation in this environment, we can better understand this phenomenon.
We reviewed current LLMs, explored misinformation risks, and applied sota
finetuning techniques. Using Microsoft phi2 model, finetuned with our custom

safeguards against misinformation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16241v1,LLM
Towards Enhancing Linked Data Retrieval in Conversational UIs using Large Language Models,"Omar Mussa, Omer Rana, Benoît Goossens, Pablo Orozco-Terwengel, Charith Perera",2024-09-24 16:31:33+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16220v1,"Despite the recent broad adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across

conversational user interfaces (UIs) and their capabilities for data extraction
by producing more accurate SPARQL queries without the requirement for model

introduction of new datasets or updates, limiting their functionality as

Second Order Bounds for Contextual Bandits with Function Approximation,Aldo Pacchiano,2024-09-24 15:42:04+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16197v1,"Many works have developed algorithms no-regret algorithms for contextual
bandits with function approximation, where the mean rewards over context-action
pairs belongs to a function class. Although there are many approaches to this
problem, one that has gained in importance is the use of algorithms based on
the optimism principle such as optimistic least squares. It can be shown the
regret of this algorithm scales as square root of the product of the eluder
dimension (a statistical measure of the complexity of the function class), the
logarithm of the function class size and the time horizon. Unfortunately, even
if the variance of the measurement noise of the rewards at each time is
changing and is very small, the regret of the optimistic least squares
algorithm scales with square root of the time horizon. In this work we are the
first to develop algorithms that satisfy regret bounds of scaling not with the
square root of the time horizon, but the square root of the sum of the
measurement variances in the setting of contextual bandits with function
approximation when the variances are unknown. These bounds generalize existing

A decision-theoretic model for a principal-agent collaborative learning problem,Getachew K Befekadu,2024-09-24 13:08:51+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16068v1,"In this technical note, we consider a collaborative learning framework with

datasets. Whereas, the agents, who act together as a team, then update their
parameter estimates using a discrete-time version of Langevin dynamics with

fundamental reason for this limitation is that current XAI methods do not
